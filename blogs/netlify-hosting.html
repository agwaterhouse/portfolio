<p>I have been lucky enough to have free web hosting for my 3 years at MMU provided by <a href="https://www.34sp.com/">34SP,</a> but with that soon to run out upon my graduation in the summer, I thought now would be a great time to sort out alternative hosting. Here’s my 5-step guide to using <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to host your portfolio site for FREE!</p><br>

<p>This tutorial assumes that you already have a free GitHub account set up, even if you’ve never even used it, you can <a href="https://github.com/join">sign up to GitHub here.</a></p>


<h2>Step 1 – Create A Repository</h2>

<p>Create a new <strong class="active">Public</strong> repository in GitHub, this will be used to store all your code and portfolio files, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images used on the site. It’s crucial that the repository is set to public, this will mean that anybody will be able to access your source code, including Netlify, which will be used host your portfolio website.</p>

<h2>Step 2 – Cloning your repository</h2>
<p>You now need to upload your files to your repository. This can be done by uploading files directly in the GitHub web UI. However, the web UI will not allow you to upload folders to your repository, meaning you will need to recreate the folder structure of your portfolio site in the GitHub UI. The easiest way of uploading your files into your repository is through the <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">desktop version of GitHub.</a> Once logged into GitHub Desktop, you need to clone your repository so that you can access it on your computer. You should see your recent repositories as soon as you’re logged in, click clone and choose a location where you would like to store your portfolio files.</p>

<p class="active">Skip to Step 4 if you used the GitHub Web UI</p>

<h2>Step 3 – Committing your files</h2>

<p>You can now simply drag and drop all your portfolio files and folders into your repository, which is stored in your chosen location. When you navigate back to GitHub desktop you should see the files you have uploaded to the repository being displayed. Provide a title and a quick summary of the files you are going to upload and click ‘Commit’. Finally, click the ‘Publish Branch’ button to sync your files up to the web version of GitHub. You should now have all your portfolio files in a public GitHub repository, ready to be hosted on Netlify.</p>

<h2>Step 4 – Hosting on Netlify</h2>

<p>Sign up for a <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">free Netlify account,</a> this will be used to host your portfolio site and will be linked to your public Git repository. Netlify has a simple user interface, and doesn’t ask for several different logins to access your website like traditional FTP hosting. Simply click ‘Sites’ in the navigation, click the GitHub option to give Netlify access to your public GitHub repositories, and select the repository you have created with your portfolio site. Click Deploy and your portfolio site is live!</p>

<h2>Step 5 – Explore Netlify</h2>

<p>You can change your domain to something more relevant to your site or even add your own domain in the site settings tab. Got a PHP contact form on your portfolio site? Unlike a web server, Netlify can’t run PHP files, however it does provide a walk around. Check out the <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/#html-forms">Netlify Form Set Up Page,</a> by simply adding a Netlify attribute to your HTML form you can receive messages from users of your portfolio site, that go straight to your Netlify account and corresponding email address.</p>

<p>That’s it, you now have your portfolio site live on the web without the annual or monthly hosting fee! Having your portfolio site public and hosted on GitHub is great, allowing potential employers to explore your source code and get a better idea of how you work.</p>
